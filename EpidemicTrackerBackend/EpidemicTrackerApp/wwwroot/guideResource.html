            Guidelines and Resources
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Infection prevention and
            control of epidemic- and
            pandemic-prone acute
            respiratory diseases in
            health care
        </h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to provide infection control guidance to help prevent the transmission
            of acute infectious respiratory diseases during health care, with emphasis on acute respiratory diseases
            that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern as defined in the International
            Health Regulations (2005; Annex 1). Managers of health-care facilities may also consider using this
            guidance to assist them in preparation for epidemics and pandemics.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document is intended to be used by government planners, health-care facility administrators,
            infection control professionals, occupational health specialists, other professionals involved in patient
            care and direct care providers
        </p>
        <p>
            The infection control advice provided in the guidelines is based on available information on the main
            routes of transmission of pathogens, and is intended to provide guidance for continuous and
            sustainable improvement in safety of health care. These guidelines are designed to offer Member
            States a conceptual framework for individual adaptation according to local regulations, settings, needs
            and resources. Health-care facilities are encouraged to review the recommendations and to adapt them
            accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The guidelines were developed after performing a systematic review of the scientific literature (in
            English) identified through PubMed (US National Library of Medicine) and the Cochrane Library,
            and secondary papers (in English, and also in Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish) identified
            from existing relevant guidelines. International and national infection control guidelines and infection
            control textbooks were also consulted. The document has undergone internal and external peer
            reviews. The Guideline Steering Group1
            evaluated the comments suggested by the reviewers
            providing guidance when opinions differed, and oversaw the incorporation of amendments and
            finalization of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            As in many other areas, the knowledge on modes of transmission of respiratory diseases is evolving
            rapidly. In addition, case surveillance and case and contact investigation are critical in defining and
            identifying changes in the epidemiology of human infections and will continue to inform infection
            control recommendations. Modifications to these guidelines will be made, as necessary, as additional
            information becomes available.
